* onLogin 
    * -> onLogin is activated when the buttom "submit" of form is pressed
    * -> onLogin verifies the form fields
    * -> onLogin active the hook state of useFetch

* useFetch 
    * -> receive a url
    * -> Send a fetch (get?)
    * -> setState: data, loading, start 

## Doubt  ?

* In the useFetch where compare the bd data with form data ?
    * this info is a request of get ??
* The overview.jsx file have a logic a bit confusing, i dont understend
* TimelySearches seems not connected to any other component
* The dashboard navbar do not have a link for browser to home
